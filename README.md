# 👋 Hi there!

I'm Tomás, an advanced Actuarial Science student and a Junior Data Analyst with a strong passion for turning data into actionable insights.  

🔍 **What I'm working on:**  
- Studying and applying data science models, including **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**, **XGBoost**, and **Neural Networks (CNN, RNN, etc.)**.  
- Diving into **Natural Language Processing**, currently exploring **Transformers** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  

📈 **What drives me:**  
I love combining my background in mathematics, statistics, and actuarial studies with hands-on data science projects — whether that’s building predictive models, exploring new machine learning techniques, or learning state-of-the-art AI.  

🚀 **What’s next:**  
I’m focused on expanding my practical experience, contributing to open-source projects, and connecting with the data science and AI community.
I'll be posting my personal projects in the next days!

💡 **Let’s connect:**  
If you have interesting projects, ideas, or want to collaborate — feel free to reach out!
